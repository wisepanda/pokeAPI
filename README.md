# PokeShuffle

Pokeshuffle is a random pokemon generator page created using [pokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/).

The project started in week two of the Bootcamp as a hackaton, but was left unfinished for long time, so as a way of refreshing Javascript and Dom manipulation I decided to pick it back up and make the page functional.

There are a few reasons why I wanted to finish this project:
- I really like pokemons
- Picking back up an old project and fixing it is very satisfying
- Check my improvement
